# 👋🏼 Hello,<br>I’m Mario−César Señoranis

I'm a software developer trying to write more, create exciting software, share what I know, and for the most, just be the best Dad I can be. I Work at [tugerente.com](https://tugerente.com/) as CTO. I also work at [humanzilla.com](https://humanzilla.com), a small two-person software agency with my Wife.

I was born, live, and work in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia.

And you've found my tiny slice of the internet.
