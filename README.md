# 👋🏼 Hello,<br/> I’m Mario−César Señoranis

I'm a software developer trying to write more, create exciting software, share what I know, and for the most, just being the best Dad I can be. I Work at ⚡️ [zapier.com](https://zapier.com/) as an Integration Software Engineer. I also work in [humanzilla.com](https://humanzilla.com), a small two-person software agency with my Wife.

I was born, live, and work in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia.

And you've found my tiny slice of the internet.
