# 👋🏼 Hello, I’m Mario-César Señoranis!

I'm a software developer striving to write more, create  software, share my knowledge, and be the best Dad I can be. I am currently a Software Engineer in the Integrations Team at [Tesorio.com](https://tesorio.com). Together with my wife, I run a small software agency [Humanzilla.com](https://humanzilla.com). Additionally, I serve as the CTO at [tuGerente.com](https://tugerente.com/).
