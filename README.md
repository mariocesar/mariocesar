## 👋🏼 Hello, I’m Mario−César Señoranis

I'm a software developer, trying to write, create, and mostly being a great father. I work at ⚡️zapier.com as an Integration Software Engineer, which I love and relish. I also work in humanzilla.com, a small boutique two-person software agency with my Wife.

I grew up, live and work from Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia.

And you’ve found my slice of the internet.
