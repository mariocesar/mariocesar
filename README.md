# 👋🏼 Hello,<br/> I’m Mario−César Señoranis

I'm a software developer trying to write more, create software, and being a good Dad. Work at ⚡️ [zapier.com](https://zapier.com/) as an Integration Software Engineer. I also work in [humanzilla.com](https://humanzilla.com), a small two-person software agency with my Wife.

I grew up, live and work from Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia.

And you've found my slice of the internet.
