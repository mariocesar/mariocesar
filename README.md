# 👋🏼 Hello, I'm Mario-César Señoranis!

I'm a software developer who writes, builds, and shares what I learn. I run a small software agency, [Humanzilla.com](https://humanzilla.com) with my wife, and I serve as CTO at [tuGerente.com](https://tugerente.com/) a LatAm Startup from Bolivia.

Earlier, I was on the Integrations teams at [Zapier](https://zapier.com) and at [Tesorio](https://tesorio.com), building app connectors and API integrations, having fun with webhooks, data ingestion, and large-scale workflows across ERPs, billing tools, and CRMs.

If you have a niche project with Django, Automations, Zapier connectors, ETL pipelines, or legacy upgrades, send us a message on [Humanzilla’s LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/humanzilla/). If you want to talk startups in LatAm, especially SMB ops, inventory/POS, team building, and growth, message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariocesar).
